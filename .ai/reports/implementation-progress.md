    - Uses `useTransition` for non-blocking UI updates
    - Integrated with `updatePassword` server action
    - Access token validation from URL parameters
    - Invalid link handling with proper error states
    - Success state with "Continue to Login" button

    - ‚úÖ `LoginForm` - login with redirect support
    - ‚úÖ `RegisterForm` - registration with auto-login
    - ‚úÖ `ForgotPasswordForm` - password reset email flow
    - ‚úÖ `ResetPasswordForm` - password update with token validation
    - ‚úÖ `LogoutButton` - secure logout with server actions

- **Complete Authentication Backend Integration**:

  - **RegisterForm Backend Integration**: Full integration of `RegisterForm.tsx` with server actions

    - Uses `useTransition` for non-blocking UI updates
    - Integrated with `register` server action for secure registration flow
    - Handles auto-login and redirect to `/generate` after successful registration
    - Proper error handling with `FormError` component display
    - Toast notifications for success/failure feedback

  - **Complete Server Actions Suite**: Implemented all auth-related server actions in `src/lib/actions/auth.actions.ts`:

    - `register()` - User registration with auto-login and redirect
    - `login()` - User authentication with redirect support
    - `logout()` - Secure logout with session cleanup
    - `sendPasswordReset()` - Password reset email with security considerations
    - `updatePassword()` - Password update with session validation

  - **Next.js Redirect Error Fix**: Resolved critical UX issue where successful operations showed errors

    - Added `isRedirectError()` utility function in `src/lib/utils.ts` to detect Next.js redirect errors
    - Updated all auth forms to ignore redirect errors (expected behavior)
    - Ensures smooth user experience without false error messages during successful operations

  - Identified the root cause: incorrect file location (`/middleware.ts` instead of `src/middleware.ts` for `src/` directory projects) and a conflict with Next.js's experimental Turbopack.
  - The middleware is now correctly protecting all authenticated routes as specified in `auth-spec.md`.
